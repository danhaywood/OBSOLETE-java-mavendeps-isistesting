*As of 1.15.0, this module has been moved into Isis core*

This module, for use within link:http://isis.apache.org[Apache Isis] applications, defines a module that can be used as a single dependency for a set of common testing libraries.
This reduces the size of the maven `pom.xml` file for that consuming module; it simply needs to reference _this_ module as a `<dependency>`.

The appropriate configuration is included in a `<profile>` which is automatically included in all builds.
This profile can be disabled using a Maven property.


== Input Properties

The plugin defines several optional properties:

[source,xml]
----
<properties>
    <isis.version>1.13.1</isis.version>
    <assertj-core.version>3.6.0</assertj-core.version>
    <hamcrest.version>1.3</hamcrest.version>
    <objenesis.version>2.2</objenesis.version>
</properties>
----

The module uses the values shown above by defaults; if required they can be overridden in the consuming module.



== How to Configure

To configure:

* add the following to the `pom.xml` of the module(s) containing tests: +
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.danhaywood.mavendeps</groupId>
        <artifactId>isistesting</artifactId>
        <version>0.0.2</version>
        <type>pom</type>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

* Override any input properties, if required (see above).


To disable the (profile contributed by this) pom, pass the following system property to `mvn`:

[source,bash]
----
mvn -Dskip.danhaywood-mavendeps-isistesting
----

== Maven deploy notes

The module is deployed using Sonatype's OSS support (see
http://central.sonatype.org/pages/apache-maven.html[user guide] and http://www.danhaywood.com/2013/07/11/deploying-artifacts-to-maven-central-repo/[this blog post]).

The `release.sh` script automates the release process.
It performs the following:

* performs a sanity check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything builds ok
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version, and tag
* performs a double check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything still builds ok
* releases the code using `mvn clean deploy`
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version

For example:

[source]
----
sh release.sh 0.0.2 \
              0.0.3-SNAPSHOT \
              dan@haywood-associates.co.uk \
              "this is not really my passphrase"
----

where

* `$1` is the release version
* `$2` is the snapshot version
* `$3` is the email of the secret key (`~/.gnupg/secring.gpg`) to use for signing
* `$4` is the corresponding passphrase for that secret key.

Other ways of specifying the key and passphrase are available, see the ``pgp-maven-plugin``'s
http://kohsuke.org/pgp-maven-plugin/secretkey.html[documentation]).

If the script completes successfully, then push changes:

[source]
----
git push origin master
git push origin 0.0.2
----

If the script fails to complete, then identify the cause, perform a `git reset --hard` to start over and fix the issue before trying again.
Note that in the `dom`'s `pom.xml` the `nexus-staging-maven-plugin` has the `autoReleaseAfterClose` setting set to `true` (to automatically stage, close and the release the repo).
You may want to set this to `false` if debugging an issue.

According to Sonatype's guide, it takes about 10 minutes to sync, but up to 2 hours to update http://search.maven.org[search].
